										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This development project is located within an exclusive Good Class Bungalow estate in prestigious District 10. This 16-unit development comprises brand new two-storey detached houses and restored conservation houses with ample land for building individually-designed extensions.</p>
<p>Built on gently sloping terrain and surrounded by densely planted trees gazetted for conservation, the Swettenham Bungalows lie in an area that was once part of a rubber estate, and where conservation houses still stand as a reminder of the colonial era.</p>
<p>Swettenham Bungalows exude a charming nostalgia while offering all the conveniences of metropolitan living that is close to nature.</p>
