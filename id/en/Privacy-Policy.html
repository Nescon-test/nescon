<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Information for EU/UK Residents</span></strong></p>
<p>I.&nbsp;<strong>Basis for handling personal information.&nbsp;</strong>We need to ensure that there is a legal basis under the GDPR/UK GDPR (as applicable) to justify our processing of your personal information. There are a number of different ways that we are lawfully able to process your personal information. We will only process your personal data if and to the extent that at least one of the following legal bases apply. We have set these out below with reference to each of the purposes set out under Section 5 (Purposes) above. Most commonly we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Where you have consented before the processing.</li>
    <li>Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter or have entered with you.</li>
    <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
    <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consent means processing your personal data where you have signified your agreement by a statement or clear opt-in to processing for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Performance of contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
<p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business and generating revenue to enable us to give you the best service and to grow and develop our business and our service offerings. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
<p>Comply with a legal obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>
<p>See the table below to find out more about the types of legal basis that we will rely on to process your personal data. Section 3 above sets out the detail of the types of personal data we collect and process for these purposes.</p>

<p>II.&nbsp;<strong>Transfer of Personal Data Overseas</strong>. As indicated in Section 7 (Transfer of Personal Data Overseas) above, your personal data will be stored in a country outside of the EU/UK (as applicable), Singapore. In any event where your personal data is stored in a country outside of the EU/UK, and in this case including with reference to onward transfers within Singapore or to entities outside of Singapore, where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any such transfers are undertaken in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>However, please note that where personal data is stored in another country, it may be accessible to law enforcement agencies in accordance with domestic laws.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>III.&nbsp;<strong>Your Rights.&nbsp;</strong>You have various rights in relation to the data which we hold about you as described below.</p>
<p>To get in touch with us about any of your rights under applicable data protection laws, please use the contact details set out above.&nbsp; We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within any time limits provided for in applicable data protection law (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled).&nbsp; Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>Right to object</strong></p>
<p>This right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>because it is in our legitimate interests to do so;</li>
    <li>to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority;</li>
    <li>to send you direct marketing materials; or</li>
    <li>for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>b)&nbsp;<strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong></p>
<p>If we obtain your consent to process your personal data for any activities, you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to use your data for that purpose unless we consider that there is an alternative legal basis to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.&nbsp; You can withdraw your consent by using the contact details provided at Section 14 (Contact Details and DPO) above. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, this does not impact the lawfulness of our processing on the basis of consent before the consent was withdrawn.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;<strong>Right to access a copy of your data</strong></p>
<p>You may ask us for confirmation of the processing of your personal data, or a copy of the information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information.&nbsp; If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless permitted by law.&nbsp; If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost.&nbsp; Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request.&nbsp; If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;<strong>Right to erasure</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we "erase" your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, this right exists where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the data are no longer necessary;</li>
    <li>you have withdrawn your consent to us using your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue;</li>
    <li>the data has been processed unlawfully;</li>
    <li>it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our obligations under law; or</li>
    <li>you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so.&nbsp; When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;<strong>Right to restrict processing</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example if you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we hold about you or you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests.&nbsp; If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.&nbsp; We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;<strong>Right to rectification</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you.&nbsp; If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.&nbsp; You may also request details of the third parties that we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to.&nbsp; Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;<strong>Right of data portability</strong></p>
<p>If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between service providers and receive a copy of your data.&nbsp; In effect, this means that you are able to transfer the details we hold on you to another third party.&nbsp; To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format so that you can transfer the data.&nbsp; Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you.</p>
<p>h)&nbsp;<strong>Rights in relation to automated decision making</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to object to being subject to a decision based on solely automated processing where this decision adversely affects your legal rights.&nbsp; Where we use your personal data for automated decision making, we will ensure to give you specific information about that processing, and you will have the right to challenge and request a review of the decision.</p>
<p>i)&nbsp;<strong>Right to complain</strong></p>
<p>You also have the right to complain to your data protection authority.</p>
<p>In the UK the data protection authority is the Information Commissioner's Office. You can contact them in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Phone: 0303 123 1113</li>
    <li>Email: casework@ico.org.uk</li>
